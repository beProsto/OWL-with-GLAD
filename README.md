## [OWL](https://github.com/beProsto/OWL) (Open Windowing Library) with [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) (OpenGL Loader)

This project aims to be a project using [`OWL`](https://github.com/beProsto/OWL) with modern OpenGL (3.3 to be exact1), using [`GLAD`](https://glad.dav1d.de/) as a binding loader.
Using GLAD instead of GLEW makes the project free of any dll files.

To clone the project:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/beProsto/OWL-with-GLAD
```
Then to compile and run the project:
```
make
```

Given you have [`make`](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) and some `C`/`C++` compiler installed, the project should run!
If you have any problems, please tell me about them!
